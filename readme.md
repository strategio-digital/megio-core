### How to debug API with [Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/14885541/2s8YsqUZuv).

If you want to use Postman to debug API, just add this script into `Postman -> Collection -> Tests` section and you will be able to use Tracy\Debuuger in Postman.
```JS
pm.test("set html", function() {
    var regex = /\"(.*)(\_tracy\_bar)/gm
    var protocol = pm.request.url.protocol
    var host = pm.request.url.host
    var port = pm.request.url.port
    var hostPort = port ? `${host}:${port}` : host

    var html = pm.response.text()
    var fixedHtml = html.replaceAll(regex, `${protocol}://${hostPort}$1$2`)

    pm.visualizer.set(fixedHtml)
});
```
